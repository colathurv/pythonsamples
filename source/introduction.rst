Python is an exhilarating language to code and the power of
what can be expressed by its libraries can sometimes appear 
almost magical when one looks at what a few lines of code can produce. 
In the current document I have endeavoured to provide samples of some 
of its constructs that I found interesting in the form of simple examples 
that demonstrate how handy they can be. 

For the purpose of consistency, all examples will be using **Python 3** .

This column is written in the spirit of a **Work in Progress !!!** that will
evolve over a period of time.
